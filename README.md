# BlackJack
Basic Blackjack game made in Python, only console mode. 1v1 against the dealer.

The dealer will always ask for another card if its score is bellow 17, the dealer only plays after the user.
The regular rules for BlackJack apply to this code, being if either score is above 21, the victory goes to the one that didnt blew up.
